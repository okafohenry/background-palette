## Background palette
Background palette is a fun web app (side project) created using React.js. it just helps developers test varying colours, in some cases colors most suitable for a web page's background..it's just a play thing lol

## Technologies Used
* React.js
* CSS

## Usage
* Type in any color/ color code of choice, background color changes once a color exists, the text ```BackGround Palette``` also changes to the inverse of the color in background. once again nothing too serious .lol
